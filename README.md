# Solid-Modeling
This project presents a complete 3D solid model of a twin-engine system, created using SolidWorks. Each engine component was designed step by step, focusing on accuracy and mechanical detail. Once all parts were modeled, they were assembled into a fully functional twin-engine layout.

🛠️ Key Highlights:
Designed and modeled using SolidWorks

Individual components created separately with precise dimensions

Final assembly showcases a realistic twin-engine setup

Includes exploded view and part relations

🎯 Objectives:
Demonstrate proficiency in SolidWorks part and assembly modeling

Understand the structural and mechanical relationship between engine parts

Apply CAD design techniques to build a complex mechanical system

📁 Project Includes:
SolidWorks part (.SLDPRT) and assembly (.SLDASM) files

Rendered images and screenshots of the final model

Optional: Exploded view or motion study (if included)
